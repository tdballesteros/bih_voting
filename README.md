Non-Nationalist Voting Patterns in Post-Conflict Countries: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina’s 1997 Municipal Elections


# Overview
This project assesses the voting patterns in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first local election after the Bosnian War (1992-1995).

## Shapefiles
Post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina shapefiles are from the University of California, Berkeley and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (2015) and the International Rice Research Institute and created by Robert J. Hijmans as part of the Global Administrative Areas 2015 (v2.8) dataset. The Inter-Ethnic Boundary Line (IEBL) - the line demarcating Republika Srpska, the Federation, and Brčko District - is derived from the municipality-level shapefile.

Modifications to these shapefiles are my own work.

## Census Data
The 1991 census data comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina's 1991 census (Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine, 1991), conducted by republic-level authorities as part of the 1991 Yugoslav census. The 2013 data comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina's 2013 census (Agencija za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine, 2016). No census occurred between these dates.

The Population according to national declaration by local communities (Stanovništvo prema nacionalnom izjašnjavanju po mjesnim zajednicama) census data file is available here: https://fzs.ba/index.php/popis-stanovnistva/popis-stanovnistva-1991-i-stariji/ 

## Election Data
Bosnia and Herzegovina's 1997 municipal election result data comes from the Central Election Commission (Centralna izborna komisija Bosne i Hercegovine, 2012).

## Death Data
Geo-referenced death data comes from two sources. The first comes from the Research and Documentation Centre Sarajevo Database and Costalli & Moro (2012).
