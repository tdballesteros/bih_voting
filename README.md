Non-Nationalist Voting Patterns in Post-Conflict Countries: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina’s 1997 Municipal Elections

# Overview
This project accesses municipal-level voting patterns in Bosnia and Herzegovina's 1997 municipal election, which occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Bosnian War (1992-95). Specifically, this project analyzes multiple factors that may predict the proportion of votes cast in a municipality for nationalist and non-nationalist political parties.

## Shapefiles
The original pre-war Bosnia and Herzegovina municipality shapefile is from Andreas Berger (2012). Modifications to include Sarajevo Centar and Sarajevo Novi Grad municipalities are derived from the post-war shapefile.

The dataset is available here:
https://www.andybeger.com/blog/2011-01-18-bosnia-1991-municipalities/

The post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina shapefiles are from the geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries Database (2025). The Inter-Ethnic Boundary Line (IEBL) - the line demarcating Republika Srpska, the Federation, and Brčko District - is derived from the municipality-level shapefile.

## Census Data
The 1991 census data comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina's 1991 census (Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine, 1991), conducted by republic-level authorities as part of the 1991 Yugoslav census. Additional breakdowns of census data at community levels include the Population according to national declaration by local communities (Stanovništvo prema nacionalnom izjašnjavanju po mjesnim zajednicama) census data file (https://fzs.ba/index.php/popis-stanovnistva/popis-stanovnistva-1991-i-stariji/). Estimates for 1991 census data by post-war municipalities is from Avdić, Mirić, Gekić, and Gekić (2022).

The 2013 data comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina's 2013 census (Agencija za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine, 2016). Bosnia and Herzegovina did not conduct a census between these dates.

## Election Data
Bosnia and Herzegovina's 1997 municipal election result data comes from the Central Election Commission (Centralna izborna komisija Bosne i Hercegovine, 2012).

## Death Data
Geo-referenced death data comes from two sources. The first comes from the Research and Documentation Centre Sarajevo Database and Costalli & Moro (2012). The second comes from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 25.1 (Davies, Pettersson, Sollenberg, and Öberg, 2025; Sundberg and Melander 2013).

## Minefield data
Estimates of minefield prevalence in Federation cantons and Republika Srpska come from the International Committee of the Red Cross (1998), who in turn obtained estimates from the United Nations Mine Action Centre (UNMAC).

Information used to calculate estimates on Brčko District's minefield prevalence came from two sources. Estimates on the area of suspected minefields in Brčko come from Bolton (2003). Estimates on the total number of minefields and average number of mines per minefield come from the United Nations (1997).
